I am Amir Habibian, research scientist (Director of Engineering) at Qualcomm AI Research. My reserach is focused on computational efficiency of computer vision models to process high resolution images and videos. Currently, I lead the Generative Vision group, which develops efficient diffusion models to generate images and videos on edge devices such as mobile and XR headsets.

I recieved my PhD on learning multimodal video representations from the [University of Amsterdam(https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/quva/index.html)] in 2016. During my studies, I received the Best Paper Award at ACM Multimedia 2014, the Best Paper Award at ASCI 2015, and top perfromer in the TRECVID video search challenge in 2014 and 2015.
