I am a research scientist interested in the **computational efficiency of neural networks**.

At [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research), I have been leading teams developing **mobile architectures** for: 
- Image and video generation
- Video perception
- Neural video compression

I did a PhD on learning **multimodal video representations** at [University of Amsterdam](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/quva/index.html).
